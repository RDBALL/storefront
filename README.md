## Problem Domain

* An ecommerce storefront using React with Redux

---

## Phase 1

* In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

---
Requirements:

* Create a visually appealing site using Material UI
* Use a Redux Store to manage the state of categories and items in the store
* Display a list of categories from state
* When the user selects (clicks on) a category â€¦
  * Identify that category as selected (change of class/display)
  * Show a list of products associated with the category
